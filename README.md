# 🏫👨‍🏫 School Management System 👨‍🏫🏫

## Description: 
Hello world! This is my school system built in Python.

This first version was created using only the Python standard library and uses SQLITE for database transactions.

My intention was only to learn more about the OOP paradigm. It was funny developing that first version. The goal for the next version is to implement it with the Flask HTTP framework.

Futhermore, this is a simple CRUD project (without the Delete) and need errors/exception treatments with more strictness.  

## How to run:
Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/farxc/School_Management_System  
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd School_Management_System
```

Start the project

```bash
  python3 main.py
```


## Features

- Allows enrollment of persons (and teachers, students), classes and subjects
- Allows assign each model in a "Class"
- Dynamic terminal (pretty too I guess)
- Dynamic Insert/Read operations from SQLITE
